## About
EFI folder for my 27" `iMac11,3` from 2010. It's based on the EFI generated by OCLP but with a few tweaks to suite my requirements.

**Supported macOS** (with this GPU and WiFi/BT Card): macOS Big Sur

> [!NOTE]
> 
> Requires Post-Install Root Patching with OpenCore Legacy Patcher to re-enable GPU and Wi-Fi.

## Tweaks
Since this iMac would require a GPU upgrade in order to run anything the newer than Big Sur properly, a lot of kexts present in the EFI generated by OCLP are not required. So I removed them, thereby reducing the amount of injected kexts from 20 to 11! See details below.

- Deleted Kexts unnecessary for running macOS Big Sur and older:

- Uses latest nightly OpenCore and Kext builds
- Changed default BG Color to grey because that's what real iMac 2010 uses.
