## About
EFI for my 27" `iMac11,3` from 2010. It's based on the EFI generated by OCLP 0.6.9 nightly but with a few tweaks to suite my configuration and requirements.

**Supported macOS** (with this GPU and WiFI/BT Card): macOS Big Sur

> **Note**: Requires Post-Install Root Patching with OpenCore Legacy Patcher.

## Specs

**Model**: `iMac11,3` Mid-2010 A1312 [base model](https://everymac.com/systems/apple/imac/specs/imac-core-i3-3.2-27-inch-aluminum-mid-2010-specs.html)

Component | Description
----------|-----------
**CPU** | Intel Core i7-870 (upgraded from i3-550)
**GPU** | ATI Radeon HD 5670 (512 MB)
**RAM** | 16 GB DRR3 by Samsung (1333 Mhz)
**Storage** | Kingston 120 GB SSD (for testing)
**Ethernet** | Broadcom BCM5701
**WiFi** | Atheros AR 9280 
**Bluetooth** | Broadcom BRCM2046

## Tweaks
Since this iMac would need a GPU upgrade in order to install and run anything newer than Big Sur, a lot of kexts present in the EFI generated by OCLP are not required, so I removed them, thereby reducing the amount of injected kexts from 20 to 11! See details below.

- Deleted Kexts unnecessary for running macOS Big Sur and older:
